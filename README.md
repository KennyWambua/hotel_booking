## Hotel Booking Database 
The SQL file creates a hotel booking database. It defines tables to manage guests, bookings, payments, rooms, add-ons, and room classifications. The guest table stores customer details, while the booking table links each guest to their reservation, including check-in and check-out dates, number of guests, and payment status. Additional services are handled through the addon and booking_addon tables. Room configurations are modeled using room_class, bed_type, and feature tables, allowing for flexible room categorization. The room table tracks each individual room, its status, and location within the hotel. Relationships between bookings and rooms are managed through the booking_room table. Overall, the schema supports core hotel operations with a focus on data integrity and modular design.
